# KO-MERGE

### Simple tool made to merge reading statistics between books when you change the original EPUB (new cover, filename, metadata, etc.) and now the MD5 hash no longer matches what KOReader had before.

## Disclaimer
- This was a weekend project to fix my issue and nothing else, It worked but YMMV, please only use this when you have made a good backup of your statistics.sqlite3 database. I am not responsible for lost stats. Used it, review it, enjoy it.

You find a Web App already running ready for use at HTTPS://SEND2EREADER.NET/KO-MERGE

## Features

- Merge multiple KOReader stats entries under one “keep” book  
- Deduplicate page-timestamp hits and recompute total read time/pages
