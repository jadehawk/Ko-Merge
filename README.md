# KO-MERGE

### Simple tool made to merge reading statistics between books when you change the original EPUB (new cover, filename, metadata, etc.) and now the MD5 hash no longer matches what KOReader had before.

---

## Features

- Merge multiple KOReader stats entries under one “keep” book  
- Deduplicate page-timestamp hits and recompute total read time/pages
